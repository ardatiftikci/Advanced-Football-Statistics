# Advanced-Football-Statistics
The advanced football statistics have gained a great importance in recent years. In this repository, I will calculate these advanced statistics through some Machine Learning Methods although the general approach is the use of Statistical Methods.

## xG
I will start with the most famous advanced football statistic called as "xG" or "Expected Goals". xG is the probability that a shot will result in a goal by looking at some characteristics of the position. It is -of course- between 0 and 1. I will use several models and several "shot datasets" for xG calculation. I will not share the datasets since I may not be permitted to share them, but I will give information about the nature of data, my preprocessing steps, finally features of the training data. Therefore, you can easily apply the same method to another dataset after some preprocessing on data.

## Further Questions and Suggestions
You can always contact me on my personal email (ardatiftikci@gmail.com) for further questions and suggestions.
